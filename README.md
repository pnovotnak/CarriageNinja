## This is something that keeps coming up in conversation between friends

There MUST be a good way to sell the few extra cubic feet in your car on that
cross-country drive, cross town hike, or weekend trip to the mountains. 
And there HAS to be a cheaper, more efficcient way to move packages for cheaper.

We think the answer is a sort of bulliten board that keeps track of who's going
where and what they can fit in their vehicle. We are of course concerned about
people taking advantage of this little utopia for drug smuggling, etc. So, we
take everybody's driver's licence number, a picture of the front and the back,
and some other details about the user that can be checked by the driver.
(We're still working out the details)

Anyway, I think this can work as an open-source project. I don't see a good
reason in this day and age that a website this simple contains enough "special
sauce" to keep it under wraps. Plus, since none of us really aspire to wealth,
we don't really give a damn if you think you can do a better job, fork and put 
up a better looking clone. We hope people will contribute to this project, 
since it seems like a genuinely good idea.

I believe this project has the capibility to eventually make domestic parcel
services obsolete. If you can put deliver a package at the expense of a few
extra blocks of driving, you've done good work.

Anyway, this project is still in it's infancy. If you want to contribute, drop
a line. At some point, ownership should be transferred to an organizational 
account, I just haven't figured out what to call the org. Or gotten it set up
yet (that whole infancy thing.)
